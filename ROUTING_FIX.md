# Routing Fix - Onboarding Flow

## Problem
The onboarding pages were blocked by the `OnboardingGuard` which required users to be authenticated before accessing them. This created a chicken-and-egg problem where users couldn't access onboarding at `/` because the guard redirected them to `/login`.

## Root Cause
The `OnboardingGuard` had an authentication check that redirected non-authenticated users to `/login`, making it impossible for anyone to start the onboarding process without first going through the login flow.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Updated Root Page Logic
**File**: `app/page.tsx`

**Before:**
- Unauthenticated users → `/login`
- Authenticated users without onboarding → `/qualifying`
- Authenticated users with onboarding → `/dashboard`

**After:**
- Anyone without completed onboarding → `/qualifying` (start onboarding)
- Authenticated users with completed onboarding → `/dashboard`

This allows **everyone** to access the onboarding flow at `/`.

### 2. Removed Authentication Check from OnboardingGuard
**File**: `components/guards/OnboardingGuard.tsx`

**Removed:**
```typescript
// Check if user is authenticated
if (!isAuthenticated()) {
  router.push('/login');
  return;
}
```

**Kept:**
- Step progression validation (can't skip ahead)
- Redirect to dashboard if onboarding is already complete

## New User Flow

### Option 1: Direct Onboarding (No Auth Required)
1. User visits `/`
2. Redirects to `/qualifying` (first onboarding step)
3. User goes through all onboarding steps
4. Can complete without authentication

### Option 2: Magic Link Flow
1. User visits `/login`
2. Enters email and receives magic link
3. Clicks magic link → goes to `/verify?token=...`
4. Gets authenticated and redirected to `/qualifying`
5. Continues through onboarding

### Option 3: Already Completed
1. User visits `/`
2. If authenticated AND onboarding complete → `/dashboard`

## Benefits
- ✅ Onboarding accessible at root `/`
- ✅ No authentication required to start onboarding
- ✅ Guards still prevent skipping steps
- ✅ Completed onboarding users go straight to dashboard
- ✅ Cleaner, more intuitive user flow

## Testing
1. Clear local storage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
3. Should redirect to `/qualifying`
4. Should be able to navigate through onboarding steps
5. Should NOT be redirected to login
