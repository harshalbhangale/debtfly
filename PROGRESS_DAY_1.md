1. **Clear localStorage:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   location.href = '/';
   ```

2. **Should redirect to `/creditors`**
   - You'll see Page 1: Creditor Selection
   - Can search and select creditors
   - Can add "Other" creditors manually
   - Click "Continue"

3. **Redirects to `/info`**
   - Shows selected creditors
   - Shows what happens next
   - Shows time estimate
   - Click "Let's Start"

4. **Currently redirects to `/contact`** (not built yet)

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Signature Approach
- ❌ Removed complex canvas drawing
- ✅ Will use styled text input (name in calligraphy font)
- Simpler, legally sufficient, better UX

### 2. Storage Strategy
- Using localStorage for now
- Designed for easy API migration
- All storage functions return/accept proper types

### 3. Component Reuse
- ✅ All UI components (button, card, etc.) - kept
- ✅ AddressSearch - will reuse in Page 5
- ❌ SignatureCanvas - will replace with styled input
- ✅ DebtCard - will reuse in Pages 6-7

### 4. Route Structure
- `(public)` - Pages 1-8, no auth
- `(auth)` - Login/verify, kept as-is
- `(portal)` - Dashboard + plan flow, auth required
- Old `(onboarding)` - will be deprecated

---

## 🎨 UI/UX Highlights

### What's Working Well:
- ✅ Clean, professional design
- ✅ Responsive (mobile-first)
- ✅ Purple/Lime color scheme applied
- ✅ Loading states and transitions
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to submit)

### Improvements Made:
- Better progress indication
- Clearer call-to-actions
- More reassuring copy
- Time estimates
- Visual feedback on selection

## 📝 Notes

1. **Guards are disabled** - Temporarily disabled for development. Will re-enable with proper logic for portal routes.

2. **Old onboarding routes** - Still exist but not linked. Will be deprecated once new flow is complete.

3. **No breaking changes** - New routes don't interfere with old ones. Can develop in parallel.

4. **Mobile-friendly** - All new pages are responsive and tested on mobile breakpoints.

## 🚀 Ready for Tomorrow

Foundation is solid. Tomorrow we'll build Pages 3-5 (Contact, DOB, Address) which are simpler forms. Should complete 3 more pages easily.

**Target for end of Day 2**: Pages 1-5 complete (62.5% of public flow)
